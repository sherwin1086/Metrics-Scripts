#   GENERATING QUALYS METRICS   #
#################################

Important Notes:
  # There are several reports used to compile the Qualys metrics. As such, these reports are organized into different directory structures which are needed for the scripts to run properly.

  stats ->	data       			->	archive	->	[old raw reports]
						                    nessus	->	[no longer used]
						                    qualys	->	[raw qualys reports - before]

			      processed_data	->	archive	->	[old metrics reports]
							                  nessus	->	[no longer used]
							                  qualys	->	[metrics reports - after]
							                  topTen	->	[top ten reports]


1) Open a new terminal window
2) Navigate to the directory where you saved all of the scripts: $ cd {$PATH}/stats/
3) Run the command: $ ./qualysReports.sh
	# This script automates the following steps:
	## Logs into Qualys via the API
	## Fetches a list of all active reports containing the term ‘metrics’ in the report title, and compiles an array using ReportID, ReportTitle, ReportSize, ReportDate, and ReportTime
	## Archives old reports into a zip file and purges all current directories & files
	## Creates new directories based on all ReportTitles from the array
	## Initiates downloading of all Qualys reports based on ReportIDs from array, and places files in the corresponding directory
	## Logs out of Qualys
4) Run the command: $ ./extractQualys.sh
	# This script automates the following steps:
	## Crawls through every directory under data/qualys/* and runs every downloaded Qualys report through the qualys.pl script to normalize the data
5) Run the command: $ ./analyze.sh
	# This script automates the following steps:
	## Compiles a device count for each Business Unit
  ## Compiles metrics broken down by month and criticality (MonthlyByCrit)
  ## Compiles longevity metrics broken down by month (VulnLongevity)
  # All files are output to the processed_data/qualys/ directory
6) Run the command: $ ./topTen.sh
  # This script automates the following steps:
  ## Compiles a list of the Top Ten vulnerabilities for each Business Unit
  # All files are output to the processed_data/topTen/ directory
7) Open the folder where all the processed reports have been saved (stats -> processed_data -> qualys)
8) Open the latest metrics XLSX file
9) Starting from the first tab in the spreadsheet, find and open the corresponding files in the report directory, and do the following:
    a) Copy the number from the *Devices.txt file, and paste in cell P2
    b) Copy the data from the *MonthlyByCrit.csv file, and paste over cells A1:M5
    c) Copy the data from the *VulnLongevity.csv file, and paste over cells A9:M13
10) Check that all formulas and graphs are intact
11) Done!
12) The Top Ten report can be found by opening the folder where all the top ten reports were saved (stats -> processed_data -> topTen), and look for the file called "TopTen.csv"
